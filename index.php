<h1 class="h">Introduction</h1>



<p>My name is Francis Jesuthasan Bevon Fernando, and I am currently pursuing a top-up course in Software Engineering from Cardiff University through ICBT. With a solid educational background that includes a Higher National Diploma in Computer Science from ANC and a Diploma in Software Engineering from NSBM, I am passionate about diving deep into the world of software development.</p>
<br>
<p>I bring with me a diverse set of skills including problem-solving, adaptability, teamwork, critical thinking, and resilience, all of which I honed through both my academic journey and professional experiences. Notably, I have worked as an IT Assistant at Cinnamon Lake, where I was outsourced by 7X, and as a Network Administrator at SK International Holdings.</p>
<br>
<p>My goal is to gain practical experience, enhance my skills further, and make meaningful contributions to a dynamic team. I am committed to continuous learning and career growth, eager to tackle new challenges, and dedicated to delivering high-quality work.</p>
